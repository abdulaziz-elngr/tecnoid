# TecnoID

TecnoID is a SaaS-style management platform for educational centers,
tutoring centers, and private-lesson providers: students, academics,
attendance, exams, finance, and communication in one system.

> **Status: Feature-complete.** Every planned phase — authentication,
> RBAC, the academic data model, attendance/QR scanning, exams and
> grading, subscriptions/payments/invoices, expenses and utilities,
> WhatsApp integration, notifications, reporting, and the full admin
> UI — has a working backend API and a matching frontend page. See
> `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for how each phase plugs into the whole.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js Route Handlers (API layer) + Prisma ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Auth:** Argon2id password hashing, signed JWT session cookie backed
  by a server-side `Session` table (real revocation, not just a
  client-side cookie)
- **Validation:** Zod on every API input
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit tests for security-critical logic)

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A running PostgreSQL instance (local, Docker, or hosted)
- (Later phases) Redis, an S3-compatible bucket, WhatsApp Business
  Platform credentials

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at minimum:

- `DATABASE_URL` — your PostgreSQL connection string
- `AUTH_SECRET` — a long random secret: `openssl rand -base64 48`

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

### 5. Seed demo data (development only)

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This creates a demo organization, branch, all default roles, a
handful of demo users, and a few demo students. Login credentials are
printed at the end of the seed run. **Never run this against a
production database** — every record is clearly labeled as demo data.

### 6. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`. You'll be redirected to `/login`.

### 7. Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

```

## Security notes (read before deploying)

See `docs/SECURITY.md` for the full list. Key points:

- Every protected API route re-derives the user's organization,
  branch scope, and permissions from the **server-side session** —
  never from client-supplied IDs.
- Students (and, in later phases, payments/attendance) are
  **soft-deleted only**; history is never destroyed.
- Every sensitive write is recorded in `AuditLog`.
- Passwords are hashed with Argon2id; login is rate-limited per IP and
  accounts lock out after repeated failures.

## Roadmap

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the phase-by-phase design covering
attendance/QR scanning, make-up group rules, exams and grading,
subscriptions/payments/invoices, expenses and utilities, WhatsApp
integration, notification rules, reporting, and deployment. Further
